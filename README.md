# Budget Wise

## Dynamic Programming based Knapsack

= Introduction=

Dynamic programming is an algorithmic technique for solving an optimization problem by breaking it down into simpler subproblems and utilizing the fact that the optimal solution to the overall problem depends upon the optimal solution to its subproblems in a recursive manner. The knapsack algorithm is a famous Dynamic Programing problem that falls in the optimization category. There are various examples showing the application of knapsack, however, the most known is a scenario where a set of items have specific weights and are assigned a monetary value. The goal is to maximize the value in the knapsack(bag) while it has weight constrain.

For our project, we wanted to use knapsack for solving a real-world problem we may face as a college student. The problem we chose to work on is how a student can get as much books as they can while being under a budget constrain. We wrote a Dynamic program that uses knapsack algorithm to solve this problem, and we called our program Budgetwise. The Scenario of our project is explained below.

## Scenario

It is the first week of class and you, a college student wants to buy your books from the bookstore. However, you do not have enough money to buy all the books for all your courses, so you try to get as many course books as you can while being under budget. The problem is you have an assignment for each of your courses that are due at the same day and are worth varying percentage points for the courses. To make the best decision, you have to take into consideration the percentage points each assignment has and try to choose the books that can get you to earn as many points as possible while being under your budget.

## Why did we choose this topic?

* The idea of applying the knapsack's algorithm into the real world was interesting to us because of how it puts into consideration the constraints while trying to make the best decision that can best benefit the person. In our day-to-day life, we are consistently having to make such decisions, and so having to make a program that can help in making the best decision would be beneficial. Especially as a college student, we believe that this program can be a helpful tool to use.

## How is topic related to Discret Math

* The Knapsack algorithm uses a Recurrence relation, which relates this project to one of the topics that we have learned in Discrete Mathematics. This algorithm is familiar to both of us as we have learned it in our Data Structures and Algorithms class.
